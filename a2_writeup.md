# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

Learning when and how to use sind and pind was the most diffcult. This is proabbly becuase for a good part of when we were coding I had very vauge definitions of sind and pind I didn't know how to traverse through sind. 

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

I can utilize user input with the match function and the movie database in order to search for a movie in the database. This could be used in a movie theater search bar in order for the user to know if a movie is avaible where they are or if it even exists in the movie theater's database.
